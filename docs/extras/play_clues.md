### The Selfish Clue

- A *Selfish Clue* is when a player:
  1. has a playable card in their hand (e.g. red 2)
  2. gives a *Play Clue* to the next connecting card (e.g. red 3)
- In almost all cases, there is no reason to give a *Selfish Clue*. Players can simply play their playable card and let someone else on the team "get" the next card. Being *Selfish* is typically associated with having bad teamwork.
- However, in rare cases, giving a *Selfish Clue* can be good.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a globally-known playable red 2 in her hand.
  - Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `blue 1, red 3, red 4, red 5, blue 1`
  - Both Bob and Cathy has a safe discard.
  - Alice knows that on this turn, she is expected to play the red 2, unless she has a really good clue to give.
  - Alice sees that if she plays the red 2, then Bob will probably have nothing to do, and will go on to discard the blue 1.
  - At that point, the red 5 will be on chop, and it will be difficult for the team to get all of the red cards. Specifically, someone will probably have to give a number 3 clue to Bob as a 1-for-1 on the red 3.
  - Alice sees that if she gives a red clue to Bob *right now* (e.g. before she plays the red 2), then she will be able to "lock-in" a nice 3-for-1 clue. Even though the team will lose *Tempo*, this will be inconsequential because Bob has a safe discard and Cathy has a safe discard.
  - Alice clues red to Bob as a *Selfish Play Clue*.

### The Negative 5's Tempo Clue (or Inverted 5's Tempo Clue)

- Normally, if a color clue "fills in" a 5 (that was previously touched), and the clue touches no other cards in the hand, then it is obviously focused on the 5 - the 5 is playable right now.
- However, as a special exception, if doing so makes *another* 5 in that player's hand known to be playable, then the clue is said to be focused on the other 5, making the original card clued **not** playable right now.
- Since *Negative 5's Tempo Clues* only get one card played, they are also *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* like any other *Tempo Clue*.

### The Double Tempo Clue Inversion (Immediate Double Clue)

- If a player is clued the exact same thing twice before it gets to be their turn, it means that they can play **all** of the cards that the clue touched, but in the opposite order than normal (right-to-left, since you would normally play cards from left-to-right).
  - If one of the cards includes the chop card, it means to play all of the cards from 2nd oldest to newest, and then the chop last.
- If you are re-clued about a bunch of cards after you have already taken a turn, see the *Double Tempo Clue* section.

### The Continuation Clue (Touching Both Inside and Outside a Layer)

- Sometimes, a player who is blind-playing cards into a *Layered Finesse* receives another clue that touches cards **both** inside the layer and outside the layer.
- By default, the player should assume that it is another normal *Play Clue* or *Save Clue* on a card outside of the layer, and **continue** to blind-play cards. This follows from *Information Lock Principle*. *Play Clues* given in this manner are called *Continuation Clues*.
- Because *Continuation Clues* are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a *Fix Clue*, since a *Fix Clue* must **only** touch cards inside of the layer.

### Selfish Focus Inversion (SFI)

- First, see the section on the *[Selfish Clue](#the-selfish-clue)*.
- Normally, when a player gives a *Selfish Clue*, they are doing it because no-one else on the team can perform the clue and they want to "lock-in" the value.
- However, if a player gives a *Selfish Clue* with a color, and that clue could have been easily given by someone else on the team, then that is quite strange. They must be trying to send a deeper message.
- In this situation, they are trying to communicate that the focus of the clue should be inverted. The *Play Clue* is either on the left-most card (if it would normally be *Chop Focus*) or on the right-most card (if it would normally be the left-most card).
- *Selfish Focus Inversion* can **only** be performed with color clues.
- *Selfish Focus Inversion* takes precedence over an *Out-of-Order Finesse*. (This follows from *Occam's Razor*; if it could just be a normal *Focus Inversion* play clue, then it does not necessarily promise any blind-plays.)
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob clues blue to Alice as a *Play Clue* on a blue 1.
  - Instead of playing her red 1, Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 on slot 1 and a red 2 on slot 2. This must be a *Play Clue*, since these cards are not on Donald's chop.
  - Donald knows that since Cathy is not playing her red 1 and giving a clue, she must have a good reason.
  - Donald looks around the table and does not see the red 2 in anybody else's *Finesse Position*. Thus, this cannot be a *Selfish Finesse*.
  - Donald also knows that this cannot be a *Self Finesse*. (Donald has a negative red clue on his *Finesse Position* card.)
  - Thus, this must be a *Selfish Focus Inversion*, so Donald marks his right-most card as red 2 for later. The other red card in his hand can be red 3, red 4, or red 5. Donald discards.
- Note that *Selfish Focus Inversion* is not allowed in variants with a rainbow or prism suit. In that case, the player is simply giving a play clue to a rainbow/prism card.
