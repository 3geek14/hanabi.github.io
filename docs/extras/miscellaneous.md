### The Hesitation Blind-Play

- Sometimes, a player will receive a *Play Clue* on a card. And then, instead of playing it, they will discard their chop instead. This would normally indicate some sort of emergency. However, sometimes it can be seen that there is nothing special going on and that everybody has safe chop cards.
- In such a situation, if the player is not making a mistake, the only reason that they would discard is that they are allowing for the possibility of a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse* - someone else on the team has a playable card (either clued or on *Finesse Position*) that "matches" the card that they got the *Play Clue* on.
- Depending on the game state, clever players may be able to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card in response to this hesitation, getting a card for "free". This kind of move is called a *Hesitation Blind-Play*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and all of the other 2's are played on the stacks.
  - The team has 5 clues. Nobody on the team has any cards clued in their hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a blue 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*. (The team is now at 4 clues.)
  - Bob discards. (The team is now at 5 clues.)
  - From Cathy's perspective, Bob was supposed to play the blue 3 immediately instead of discarding.
  - Cathy knows that since the team has so many clues available, this cannot be a *Scream Discard* from Bob. (*Scream Discards* are only typically done when the team is at 0 or 1 clues.)
  - Thus, Cathy knows that Bob must be hesitating because is he allowing for the possibility of a *Reverse Finesse*. In this situation, the only possible card that could Bob could be hesitating for is red 2.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob knows that since Cathy blind-played the red 2, Alice did a *Reverse Finesse* and that he has the red 3.
  - Bob plays the 3, but it is revealed to be blue 3 instead of red 3.
  - Bob now knows that nobody has the red 3 and that Cathy blind-played the red 2 from Bob's hesitation.
- *Hesitation Blind-Plays* are **not always safe** to do:
  - If a player could be hesitating for a clued card in your hand **or** your *Finesse Position* card, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you guess wrong, you could misplay a critical card.)
  - If a player could be hesitating for a card that is identical to the card that was clued, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you blind-play the same copy of the card, then they will go on to misplay the clued card.)
  - If blind-playing a particular card would cause the original clue to look like a *Double Finesse* with a "self" component, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (For example, if a number 4 clue causes a *Hesitation Blind-Play* of a red 2, the clue receiver would go on to misplay their *Finesse Position* card as the red 3.)

### The Hesitation Chop Move (From a Misplay)

- Remember that as a special exception, *Scream Discards* do **not** apply when a player has a "blind" card to play in their hand **and** the blind card can exist in your hand.
- Thus, when this occurs, you will usually want to blind-play your *Finesse Position* card, since this sequence of events indicates either an *Ambiguous Finesse* or a *Pass Bluff*.
- When you blind-play a card in this situation and it misplays, it means that the unusual discard really was a *Scream Discard* after all, so you should treat it like a normal *Scream Discard* and permanently *Chop Move*.
- This is called a *Hesitation Chop Move* for short, since it was triggered by a (failed) *Hesitation Blind-Play*.

### Double Prompts in Multi-Color Variants

- Normally, when a multi-color card is *Prompted* from someone's hand, they should play the card that has the most positive information.
- However, what if they are *Prompted* for two cards of the same multi-color suit? They should play the card with the most positive information first, even if it is not the left-most card.
- For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  - Rainbow 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a slot 1 card that has a blue clue on it. (Thus, it is either a blue card or a rainbow card.)
  - Bob also has a slot 3 card that has a blue clue and a red clue on it. (Thus, it is a known rainbow card.)
  - Alice clues Cathy about a rainbow 4.
  - Bob is promised the rainbow 2 and the rainbow 3, so he knows that these cards must be on slots 1 and slot 3.
  - However, Bob also knows that you should always play the card with the most information on it first, so he plays his slot 3 card as rainbow 2 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).

### The Elimination Rewrite (for 1's)

- Normally, when a playable card is discarded, a player will write *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the other copy of the card.
- However, there is a special case when **two** copies of the same 1 are discarded. The original *Elimination Notes* from the discard of the first 1 no longer apply because it is possible that the player has drawn the third copy of the 1 before the second copy could be clued.
- Thus, when a player discards the second copy of a playable 1, they should delete all of their *Elimination Notes* from the first discard and rewrite all of the *Elimination Notes* on the rest of their hand anew (essentially acting like the second discard was the first discard).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards a red 1. Alice writes *Elimination Notes* on her slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - On her next turn, Alice discards an unrelated card. She now has *Elimination Notes* on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - On her next turn, Alice discards another red 1. Normally, she would now have *Elimination Notes* on slot 4 and slot 5. However, because of the *Elimination Rewrite*, she instead writes *Elimination Notes* on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

### The Negative Blind-Play

- Given enough negative clues on a card (and potentially some ancillary information based on the history of the game), it is possible to narrow down the identity of an unclued card in your hand to possibilities that only include playable cards that are not already touched in someone else's hand.
- In this situation, you are expected to blind-play the card.

### The Negative Self-Chop Move

- If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.
- In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.
- Thus, the player should self-chop move the card.

### The Layered Jump

- If a player who is blind-playing into a *Layered Finesse* skips over a card, they are performing a *Layered Jump*. This player has deduced that the card they are skipping over is duplicated (or otherwise bad).
- The card skipped over in this way will be the next thing discarded, as it is now considered known trash.
- If a *Layered Jump* skips over a card that cannot be in your own hand, then you can determine that it must be a mistake. In this situation, the skipped-over card must be clued directly to re-signify that it is good.
