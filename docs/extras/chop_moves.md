### Double Order Chop Move (for 3-Player Games)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- In the *Order Chop Move*, players can play 1's in a certain order to *Chop Move* a specific player of their choosing.
- In a 4 or 5-player game, skipping over three 1's would *Chop Move* the player three seats away. However, in a 3-player game, this would be nonsensical, since there are only 3 players in total.
- Thus, in a 3-player game, skipping over three 1's should *Double Chop Move* the very next player.
- In the rare case where four things are skipped over, it should skip over the next player and *Double Chop Move* the player after that.

### Spillover Chop Move

- If an *Order Chop Move* or a *Trash Order Chop Move* is performed, but the player who is supposed to *Chop Move* already has every single card in their hand clued, then this is very strange.
- In this situation, the *Chop Move* should "skip" over that player and *Chop Move* the next person after that.
