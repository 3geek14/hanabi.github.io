### Double Order Chop Move (for 3-Player Games)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- In the *Order Chop Move*, players can play 1's in a certain order to *Chop Move* a specific player of their choosing.
- In a 4 or 5-player game, skipping over three 1's would *Chop Move* the player three seats away. However, in a 3-player game, this would be nonsensical, since there are only 3 players in total.
- Thus, in a 3-player game, skipping over three 1's should *Double Chop Move* the very next player.
- In the rare case where four things are skipped over, it should skip over the next player and *Double Chop Move* the player after that.

### Spillover Chop Move

- If an *Order Chop Move* or a *Trash Order Chop Move* is performed, but the player who is supposed to *Chop Move* already has every single card in their hand clued, then this is very strange.
- In this situation, the *Chop Move* should "skip" over that player and *Chop Move* the next person after that.

### The Hesitation Chop Move (From a Misplay)

- First, see the section on the *[Scream Discard](level_6.md#the-scream-discard-chop-move) and the *[Hesitation Blind-Play](level_21.md#the-hesitation-blind-play)*.
- Remember that as a special exception, *Scream Discards* do **not** apply when a player has a "blind" card to play in their hand **and** the blind card can exist in your hand.
- Thus, when this occurs, you will usually want to blind-play your *Finesse Position* card, since this sequence of events indicates an *Ambiguous Finesse*.
- When you blind-play a card in this situation and it misplays, it means that the unusual discard really was a *Scream Discard* after all, so you should treat it like a normal *Scream Discard* and permanently *Chop Move*.
- This is called a *Hesitation Chop Move* for short, since it was triggered by a (failed) *Hesitation Blind-Play*.

### The Negative Self-Chop Move

- If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.
- In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.
- Thus, the player should self-chop move the card.
