## Conventions

### Charms

- *Charm* is similar to *Ejection* and *Discharge*, except the *Forth Finesse Position* card is blind-played.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Charm* can only be performed on the very next player.
- Several different kinds of moves can cause a *Charm*. The most common one is the *4 Charm*.

<br />

## Special Moves

### The Occupied Play Clue & The Occupied Finesse (OPC)

- If a clue could be given by multiple players, who should give the clue? If some players have known-playable cards and other players have nothing to do, then it makes the most sense to leave the clue for the players who have nothing to do.
- If someone gives a clue with a globally-known playable card in their hand and forces the next player to have nothing to do, this is bad teamwork - unless there was a reason!
- When this occurs, the clue should do one "extra" thing:
  - If the clue would normally be interpreted as a *Save Clue*, then it transforms into an *Occupied Play Clue*.
  - If the clue would normally be interpreted as a *Play Clue* or a *Prompt*, then it transforms into an *Occupied Finesse*.
- Note that the concept of being *Occupied* generalizes to lots of different kind of moves. For example, when an *Occupied* player clues an off-chop 5, it is certainly not a *5 Stall* - it must be an *Occupied 5 Pull*!

### The Out-of-Order Play Clue (Triple O / OOO)

- Sometimes, a player will have two playable cards in their hand of the same suit, but they will be "blocked", meaning that both a color clue and a number clue will not be able to focus the first playable card.
- One technique to get around this is to give a clue that focuses the wrong card, and then have the next player give a *Fix Clue*. This is called an *Out-of-Order Play Clue* because the cards were originally out-of-order, but the original focus is still playable.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy hand is as follows, from left to right: `red 4, red 1, red 2, red 3, blue 4`
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching slot 1, slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - Bob sees that Alice has indicated to Cathy that she has the red 1 on slot 1. Cathy will go on to misplay the red 4 as the red 1.
  - Normally, Bob would think this is a *Finesse* and try to play the red 1 into the red 4. However, that doesn't make any sense, because Cathy has the red 1, and then Alice would be violating *Good Touch Principle*.
  - Instead, Bob knows that the team should be using Cathy's red 1. Thus, Bob knows that he needs to give a *Fix Clue* to Cathy, because Alice intends for her and Bob to work together.
  - Bob clues number 4 to Cathy, touching the blue 4 and "filling in" the red 4.
  - Cathy is surprised because the card that she thought was red 1 is actually a red 4. Cathy knows that since the red 4 was the original focus of Alice's clue, then it must actually be playable right now. Thus, Cathy must have the red 1, the red 2, and the red 3.
  - Cathy plays the red 1 from slot 2 (the left-most red card that could be the red 1). She will go on to play the red 2, the red 3, and the red 4.
  - Cathy (and everyone else on the team) knows that even though the blue 4 was the focus of Bob's clue, it is not actually playable right now, and was just "collateral damage" of Bob's required *Fix Clue*.

### The Out-of-Order Finesse

- Sometimes, a *Finesse* is initiated by giving a color clue to two or more cards where the next card in the sequence is clued, but it is **not** the focus of the clue.
- When this happens, the *Finesse* will still work: a player will blind-play a matching card. However, a *Fix Clue* must then be given to the player who originally received the clue, or they will go on to misplay.
- Normally, after receiving a *Fix Clue*, a player would normally "stop" and not assume anything else about his hand. However, this is a special situation: when the original *Finesse* was given, it was a message that the focus of the clue was playable. *Information Lock Principle* applies, and it means that the original focus of the clue is also playable.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a red 3 and a red 2 (on slots 1 and 2 respectively).
  - Cathy has a red 1 on slot 1 (in *Finesse Position*).
  - Alice clues Bob red (as an *Out-of-Order Reverse Finesse*). The focus of the clue is the red 3 on slot 1.
  - Bob sees the red 1 on Cathy's *Finesse Position*, so he has to respect that it could be *Reverse Finesse*. Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 1.
  - Alice must now give a *Fix Clue* to Bob, or else red 3 will be misplayed as red 2.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob.
  - Bob plays red 2.
  - Bob knows that his other red card **must** be red 3, since it was originally clued as playable and it caused a *Reverse Finesse*.

#### Interaction with 5 Color Ejection

* The *5 Color Ejection* takes precedence over the *Out-of-Order Finesse* as long as the two-or-more-blind-plays rule is satisfied.
* For example, in a 3-player game, this would be a *5 Color Ejection*:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1, a red 1 on slot 2, and a red 2 on slot 3.
  * Bob knows that this could be an *Out-of-Order Finesse*. Specifically, if Bob gives a follow-up number 5 *Fix Clue* to Cathy, then Cathy would play the red 1, Cathy would play the red 2, and Bob would blind-play the red 3, Bob would blind-play the red 4, into Cathy's red 5.
  * However, this line would require Bob to blind-play 2 cards, so Bob knows that he should prefer a *5 Color Ejection* instead.
* For example, in a 3-player game, this would be an *Out-of-Order Finesse*:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1, a red 1 on slot 2, a red 2 on slot 3, and a red 4 on slot 4.
  * Bob knows that this could be an *Out-of-Order Finesse*. Specifically, if Bob gives a follow-up number 5 *Fix Clue* to Cathy, then Cathy would play the red 1, Cathy would play the red 2, Bob would blind-play the red 3, Cathy would play the red 4, and then Cathy would play the red 5.
  * Since this line only requires that Bob blind-plays 1 card, he knows that it cannot be a *5 Color Ejection*, so Bob performs the *Fix Clue* to allow for the *Out-of-Order Finesse*.

### The Good Touch Bluff

- Care has to be taken so that a *Bluff* does not look like a *Finesse*. For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 4, which touches a red 4.
  - Bob blind-plays a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Since 3 matches 4, Cathy knows she has the blue 4, and goes on to misplay red 4 as blue 4.
  - Thus, Alice should not have given this clue.
- However, what if someone else on the team already has the matching card? In this situation, the clue can be given without fear: from *Good Touch Principle*, the clue recipient will know that it is a *Bluff* instead of a *Finesse*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 4, which touches a red 4.
  - Bob blind-plays a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy's first thought is that since 3 matches 4, she must have the blue 4. However, Cathy sees that Donald already has a clued blue 4 it in his hand. (The blue 4 just has a blue clue on it and the true identity of the card is not yet known to Donald.)
  - Cathy knows that she must **not** have the blue 4, because then Alice's clue would have violated *Good Touch Principle*. Cathy can reason that her 4 is instead some **other** *one-away-from-playable* 4. The only other valid *Bluff* target is the red 4 (because the only *one-away-from-playable* 4 is red 4). So, Cathy marks her number 4 card as a red 4, and discards.
  - Donald is surprised by Alice's clue. From Donald's perspective, Cathy should have misplayed the red 4 as the blue 4, since 3 matches 4.
  - Since Cathy did not misplay, Donald can reason that **he** must have the blue 4. Donald marks the previously unknown blue card in his hand as blue 4.

### The Pestilent Double Bluff (PDB)

- First, see the section on the *[Good Touch Bluff](#the-good-touch-bluff)*.
- In the *Good Touch Bluff*, a *Bluff* is given that looks like a *Finesse*. However, what a *Good Touch Bluff* is performed and the "matching" card is not yet clued?
- In this situation, if the cluer is not making a mistake, they are trying to send a deeper message - they want an extra person to blind-play.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice goes first.
  - Bob has a red 1 on slot 1 and a blue 2 on slot 2.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching a blue 2 on slot 2.
  - Bob does not see any other 1's on *Finesse Position*. Thus, the number 2 clue must be a *Self-Finesse*, so he blind-plays a red 1. Bob now knows that his clued 2 is a red 2 and marks it accordingly.
  - Cathy comes next. From Cathy's perspective, Bob will incorrectly mark his 2 as a red 2 (but it is really a blue 2). If nothing else happens, Bob will go on to misplay that card.
  - Cathy knows that technically, she could give a *Fix Clue* to Bob to fix the situation. However, is that what Alice really intended? That would be a waste of a clue and would be really inefficient. Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a *Pestilent Double Bluff*, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob gasps in surprise when Cathy blind-plays. He knows that the only reason that Cathy would blind-play is because of Alice's clue. This must be what Alice intended all along, which means that Bob must not actually have the red 2. (The red 2 is already played now, so Bob knows that Alice would not violate *Good Touch Principle*.) Bob updates his note from "red 2" to "blue 2, green 2, yellow 2, or purple 2".
- In this example, Cathy knows that the initial clue was "diseased", and Cathy blind-plays a card to "heal" the situation. This is where the name *Pestilent Double Bluff* comes from.
- In this example, Cathy blind-plays the exact copy of the card that Bob was mistaken about. However, notice that Cathy could actually blind-play **any** playable card. Even if Cathy does not blind-play the red 2, blind-playing a card would still "heal" the situation, because Bob would know that Cathy is blind-playing from Alice's clue.
- A *Pestilent Double Bluff* is similar to a normal *Double Bluff* in that it gets two people in a row to blind-play their *Finesse Position*, getting two unrelated cards. However, unlike a normal *Double Bluff*, a *Pestilent Double Bluff* is initiated by cluing a *one-away-from-playable* card (instead of a two-or-more-away-from-playable card).
- Furthermore, consider the case where Cathy sees a red 2 in the middle of someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Cathy could just give a *Play Clue* to the red 2 in Donald's hand, Donald would play the card. This clue would "heal" the situation, because Bob would no longer think that he has the red 2. However, we agree that Cathy should **not** do this and should **still** blind-play her *Finesse Position* card. (This is because doing something weird like this for a 3-for-2 is not strong enough.)
- Additionally, consider the case where Cathy sees **both** copies of red 2 in someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Bob would not go on to misplay the red 2, so no further action is needed to heal the situation. However, we agree that Cathy should **still** blind-play her *Finesse Position* card (as a *Known Pestilent Double Bluff*). (This is because seeing both copies is so rare that we do not want complicate things by having to consider it.)
- More examples of a *Pestilent Double Bluff* can be found [here](examples/pestilent_double_bluff.md).

### The No-Information Double Finesse

- Sometimes, a card that is two-away-from-playable is re-clued in order to initiate a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. Most times, the clue will "fill in" or give extra information to the existing card.
- Other times, the clue will give no information (e.g. re-cluing number 3 to an already known 3). In this situation, if it was merely a *Bluff*, it would be pretty low value.
- Thus, by convention, a "no information" clue on a two-away-from-playable card **must** "get" at least 2 new cards (as opposed to a single *Bluff* that only gets 1 brand new card).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  - Bob blind-plays red 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the red 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*. Bob sees that Cathy does not have the red 2, so he must have the red 2, and can blind-play it on his next turn.
- The "no-information" principle can also be used to perform a *No-Information Layered Finesse* on the next player. (The next player will know that it is a *Layered Finesse* instead of a *Bluff* because some other more-useful clue could have been given to initiate the *Bluff*.)

### The No-Information Double Bluff

- Usually, a "no-information" clue conveys a *Double Finesse*. But you can also use it to perform a *Double Bluff* (or a *Double Half Bluff*). For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  - Bob blind-plays green 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the green 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*.
  - Cathy sees that Bob does not have the green 2, so she must have the green 2, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, and it is yellow 1 instead of green 2.
  - Since two cards were blind-played (that did not match), everyone now knows that the *No-Information* clue was a *Double Bluff* instead of a *Double Finesse*. From Cathy's perspective, her 3 can (still) be any 3 at all.

### 4 Charm

- When a *Play Clue* is given to a 4 that is not yet playable, Bob must react:
  - The first interpretation is that it is a *Prompt*.
  - If Bob has no matching cards in his hand, then a *Prompt* is impossible.
  - The second interpretation is that it is a *Finesse*.
  - If Bob sees that he would have to **blind-play one card** or **blind-play two cards** to fulfill a *Finesse*, then he should assume that it is a *Finesse*.
  - If Bob sees that he would have to **blind-play three cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely.
  - The third interpretation is that it is a *4 Double Bluff*.
  - If Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card (or a *one-away-from-playable* card) on her *Finesse Position*, then a *4 Double Bluff* is impossible.
  - The fourth interpretation is a *4 Charm*; Bob should play his *Fourth Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 clue to Cathy, touching a red 4 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *Finesse* on the red 4, meaning that he should blind-play a red 1, a red 2, and a red 3. (Bob does not see any red cards in anyone else's hands.)
  - Since the *Finesse* requires three blind-plays, it is unlikely, and Bob knows he is supposed to revert to a different interpretation.
  - Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card (or a *one-away-from-playable* card) on her *Finesse Position*, so a *4 Double Bluff* is impossible.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *4 Charm*. He blind-plays his *Fourth Finesse Position*. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- *4 Charms* can be given with either a color clue or a number clue.
- Similar to a *5 Color Ejection*, *Prompts* don't factor into the "three or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
- *4 Charms* take precedence over *Safety Charms*. (*Safety Charms* are an advanced move that is covered later.)

### Finesses with a Lie Component

- *Lie Principle* states all that *Fibs* must resolve immediately. An untruth that does not resolve immediately is a *Lie*.
- Normally, *Lies* are expressly illegal. However, some players will occasionally break the rules for the purposes of getting a *Finesse*. We call such moves *Finesses with a Lie Component*.
- Typically, when players *Lie* out of *Bluff Seat*, the game quickly falls apart; subsequent clues will have different meanings to different players and everyone will become "desynchronized". This typically leads to a loss.
- With that said, it is sometimes possible to construct **safe** lines that contain a *Lie Component*. There is usually deep levels of nuance involved in these lines, so this kind of thing is only recommended for advanced and expert players.
- The previously mentioned *Out-of-Order Finesse* is a specific example of a *Finesse* with a *Lie Component*. One key attribute of the *Out-of-Order Finesse* is that the player who receives the *Fix Clue* knows that **all** of the related cards are playable, or it would not have been worth the risk (and the confusion) to perform a line with a *Lie Component* in the first place.
- This concept can be generalized to all *Finesses* that have a *Lie Component*. After a player receives a *Fix Clue* in such a situation, they should assume that the *Finesse* is "still on". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an *Out-of-Order Finesse*) or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial *Finesse* (if the card clued with a *Fix Clue* seems to be unrelated).
- Importantly, *Finesses* with a *Lie Component* are **only** allowed if there is not an alternative line that would "get" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a *Finesse* with a *Lie Component*, make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.
