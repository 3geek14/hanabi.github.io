### The Unnecessary Generation Discard

- Sometimes, in order to satisfy *Save Principle*, a player will perform an unnecessary *Generation Discard*, which generates a clue to save a card that they actually already have in their hand.
- This puts the next player in an ambiguous situation: was it really a *Generation Discard*, or could it a *Scream Discard*? In order to cover both situations, they should not *Chop Move*, but they should also not discard on this turn.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks. No blue cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a blue 1 in her hand. She knows the exact identity of it, so it is known playable.
  - Alice also has a 4 clued in her hand. She does not know what color it is.
  - There are 0 clues, so if Alice plays the blue 1, Bob will be forced to discard.
  - Alice sees that Cathy has a red 4 on chop, which is playable. If Alice does not have red 4 in her hand, then Cathy could potentially discard the red 4 (after Bob is forced to discard).
  - So, Alice performs a *Generation Discard* to generate a clue so that Bob can clue the get the red 4, if necessary.
  - Bob sees that Alice does indeed already have the red 4 in her hand, so from his perspective, if Alice was performing a *Generation Discard*, it was unnecessary.
  - However, it could also be the case that Bob's chop is unsafe. So, Bob will **not** clue the red 4 on Cathy's chop, but he **will** spend the clue in some other productive fashion. If Bob has nothing productive to do, he must "burn" a clue, similar to what happens when a *Scream Discard* occurs.

### The Shallow Discard

- At the end of the game, it is normal for players to use a *Positional Discard* to get 1 card to blind-play, and to use a *Positional Misplay* to get 2 cards to blind-play.
- If a player does a *Positional Discard* to only get 1 card when they could have performed a *Positional Misplay* instead, then this is quite strange. If they are not making a mistake, they must be trying to send an additional message.
- In this situation, they intend for it to promise 3 blind-plays instead of 1.
- This is called a *Shallow Discard* because from Bob's perspective, Alice could have performed a deeper move.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - The team has 0 strikes.
  - It is the *End-Game* and Alice sees all of the remaining useful cards. Thus, she can *Positionally Discard* or *Positionally Misplay* any card that she wants in her hand.
  - Alice sees that Bob, Cathy, and Donald all have playable cards on slot 2.
  - Alice blind-discards her slot 2 card as a *Shallow Discard*.
  - From Bob's perspective, he sees that Cathy and Donald have a playable card on slot 2. Thus, Bob expected Alice to perform a *Positional Misplay* or her slot 2 card.
  - When Bob sees that Alice performed a *Positional Discard* instead of a *Positional Misplay*, he knows that she must be intending for 3 blind-plays to happen (instead of 1) as a *Shallow Discard*.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card (to match Alice's slot 2 discard). It successfully plays.
  - Cathy and Donald are both in a similar situation to Bob. (They expected Alice to perform a *Positional Misplay*.)
  - Thus, they both know that this is a *Shallow Discard*, and blind-play their slot 2 cards (to match Alice's slot 2 discard).
- In some specific situations, a *Positional Discard* from chop would not work, because it would just look like a normal discard. In these situations, a *Positional Misplay* would only get 1 blind-play (instead of 2) and a *Shallow Discard* would only get 2 blind-plays (instead of 3).

### The Shallow Misplay

- First, see the section on the *[Shallow Discard](#the-shallow-discard)*.
- In a 5-player game, it possible to perform a *Shallow Misplay*, causing 4 people to blind-play from the same slot. (This works for the same reasons that a *Shallow Discard* works.)
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - The team has 0 strikes.
  - It is the *End-Game* and Alice sees all of the remaining useful cards. Thus, she can *Positionally Discard* or *Positionally Misplay* any card that she wants in her hand.
  - Alice sees that Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily all have playable cards on slot 2.
  - Alice blind-plays her slot 2 card as a *Shallow Misplay*.
  - From Bob's perspective, he sees that Cathy, Donald, and Emily have a playable card on slot 2. Thus, Bob expected Alice to perform a *Shallow Discard* or her slot 2 card.
  - When Bob sees that Alice performed a *Positional Misplay* instead of a *Shallow Discard*, he knows that she must be intending for 4 blind-plays to happen (instead of 2) as a *Shallow Misplay*.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card (to match Alice's slot 2 discard). It successfully plays.
  - Cathy, Donald, and Emily are all in a similar situation to Bob. (They expected Alice to perform a *Shallow Discard*.)
  - Thus, they all know that this is a *Shallow Misplay*, and blind-play their slot 2 cards (to match Alice's slot 2 discard).
