### 2 Saves (Off Chop on the First Turn)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- On the first turn of the game, it is not possible to discard. If there is absolutely nothing else to do, it is permissible in this situation to use a number 2 clue to save a 2 that is **not** on chop, but only if the other players can see that you had no other choice.

### 2 Saves (Advanced Section; Interaction With 5's Chop Moves / 5 Pulls)

- Normally, in the *Early Game*, if a player performs a number 5 clue on an off-chop 5 and there are other things to do, this is normally a *5's Chop Move* or a *5 Pull*.
- However, to the person receiving the number 5 clue, what if the only thing left to do is a *2 Save* on someone's chop? Note that *2 Saves* are not required on 2's that are visible in other people's hands. If the person receiving the number 5 clue has the other copy of the 2 in their hand, then the 5 clue would just be a normal *5 Stall*.
- In this situation, the player is expected to mark *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the other copy of the 2. Furthermore, they are not allowed to save the other copy of the 2, so they must give some other clue or discard.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  - From Bob's perspective, he does not see any other *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* that Alice could have given, with the exception of a *2 Save* on a red 2 on Cathy's chop.
  - Thus, Alice's number 5 clue could be either a *5 Pull* or a *5 Stall*, depending on whether or not Bob has the other copy of the red 2 in his hand.
  - Bob knows that in this situation, *5 Stalls* take precedence over *5 Pulls*, so he marks his hand for the other copy of red 2 and discards.

### 2 Saves (Advanced Section; Interaction With Double Chop 2's and 5 Stalls)

- Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *5 Stall* in the *Early Game* (or another valid stalling situation) only if there is no normal *Save Clues* to give.
- However, what if the same 2 is on the chop of two different players?
  - Normally, when two different players have the same 2, no-one is required to give a *Save Clue* to the first one.
  - But when *both* of the 2's are on chop, the team has to choose to save one of them and they can choose whichever player that they want.
- Subsequently, it is **illegal** for someone to perform a *5 Stall* if both copies of the same 2 are both on the chop of two different players. They must instead choose to save one of the 2's.

### Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable

- Often times, a player will have two similar clued cards in their hand with the left-most being unplayable and the right-most being playable. In this situation, the other members of the team cannot use a *Prompt* to "get" the cards, since the left-most would misplay.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Earlier on in the game, Bob was given a *2 Save* clue. Now, he has a playable red 2 on his slot 5 and an unplayable blue 2 on his slot 4.
  - Cathy has a red 3 on her chop.
  - If Alice clued the red 3 in Cathy's hand, Bob would be *Prompted* for slot 4, and blue 2 would misplay.
- In this example, Cathy's red 3 is in danger of being discarded soon, so Alice is in a rough spot. From *Save Principle*, Alice is expected to not let the playable red 3 get discarded. But cluing the red 3 would cause Bob to misplay the valuable blue 2.
- Players in this kind of situation will generally solve it in two ways:

#### A Tempo Clue + A Play Clue

- Two players can work together. One player can give a *Tempo Clue* to the unpromptable card, and the other player can give a *Play Clue* to the next card.
- Alternatively, one player can give a *Tempo Clue* to the unpromptable card and assume that the player with the next card will give some clue. Later on, someone can clue the next card.

#### A Play Clue + A Fix Clue

- If the next player will not immediately misplay, then sometimes you can give the *Play Clue* to the next card first.
- The other players on the team are expected to realize what is going on and help out by immediately giving a *Fix Clue* to the *Prompted* player before they misplay.

### The Fake Save

- We are only allowed to perform *Save Clues* on specific cards and in specific ways, as outlined in [level 1](level_1.md#save-clues). For example, we all agree that we must save 5's with number 5.
- In some specific circumstances, the team will have only one clue available and multiple cards must be saved with a single clue. In this situation, to prevent losing the game (or losing a currently-playable card), it is permissible to *Lie* to the next player and perform a *Fake Save* (e.g. a non-legal *Save Clue*).
- After a *Fake Save*, the player receiving the clue will mark their chop card as something other than what it really is. Thus, this move commits the team to giving a *Fix Clue* to repair the *Lie* at some point in the future.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has 1 clue available.
  - Bob has a red 5 on chop, followed by a red 4. The other copy of the red 4 is in the discard pile, so there are two critical cards in a row.
  - Alice is not allowed to save the red 5 with a red clue, because then it would look like a *Save Clue* on a red 4.
  - However, if Alice clues number 5 to Bob, then he will discard the red 4.
  - Thus, Alice performs a *Fake Save* on both red cards by cluing red.
  - Bob will mark his chop as the red 4, so the team will have to give him a number 5 clue as a *Fix Clue* at some point in the future. At that point, Bob will be surprised, but he will be able to retroactively see that Alice was in a very tight spot and had to give a *Fake Save*.
- Note that normally, *Fake Saves* are **only allowed as a last resort**. If there is some other line that would "work" or be safe without a *Fake Save*, then players have to prefer that. Subsequently, *Fake Saves* are extremely rare.
