### The Duplicitous Value Clue

- Normally, we do not give _Play Clues_ to duplicated cards, as that would violate _Good Touch Principle_.
- However, in some situations, it is possible to give a _Play Clue_ to Bob and trick him into playing a duplicated card. If while doing so, the clue also picked up one or more other valuable cards, then this would be a _Duplicitous Value Clue_.
- We agree that as long as this kind of clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_ (not counting the duplicated card itself), no further _Prompts_ or blind-plays are called for - the point of the clue was to simply "lock in" a save on the valuable cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a globally-known red 3.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob as a _Play Clue_, touching 2 cards.
  - Bob plays the focused 3, assuming that it is the blue 3. However, it is actually red 3, and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, since there is sufficient value in "locking in" a save on Bob's other 3.
  - Bob marks his other 3 as **any** useful 3. It is not promised to be playable. (Thus, no-one will think that it is a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.)
- For _Duplicitous Value Clues_ that do **not** meet _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, see the _[Dupe Tempo Clue Principle](#dupe-tempo-clue-principle)_ section below.

<br />

### The Duplicitous Blind-Play

- First, see the section on the _[Duplicitous Value Clue](#duplicitous-value-clue)_.
- In the _Duplicitous Value Clue_, a duplicated card is clued directly (in order to "get" some other cards). Similar to this, it is also possible to get a duplicated card to blind-play (in order to "get" some other cards). This is called a _Duplicitous Blind-Play_.
- _Duplicitous Blind-Plays_ function the same way as _Duplicitous Value Clues_ in that as long as the clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, no further _Prompts_ or blind-plays are called for.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a globally-known red 3.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, expecting it to be a blue 3 as a _Finesse_. Instead, it is a red 3, and successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Blind-Play_, since there is sufficient value in "locking in" a save on Donald's blue 4.
  - The team knows that blue 4 is not promised to be playable. (Thus, no-one will think that it is a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.)
- Note that _Duplicitous Blind-Plays_ can also be performed with certain _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and so on.

<br />

### The Duplicitous Tempo Clue

- First, see the section on the _[Duplicitous Value Clue](#duplicitous-value-clue)_ and the _[Duplicitous Blind-Play](#duplicitous-blind-play)_.
- In the _Duplicitous Value Clue_ and the _Duplicitous Blind-Play_, one or more "extra" valuable cards are touched for later. But what if this type of move is performed, but no additional valuable cards were touched?
- If a filled-in card is revealed as playable, the clue should retroactively be treated as a _Tempo Clue_. Thus, this type of clue is called a _Duplicitous Tempo Clue_.
- _Duplicitous Tempo Clues_ may or may not cause a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_. (The conditions for this are the same as a "normal" _Tempo Clue_.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Cathy holds a globally-known red 2.
  - Bob holds a previously-touched green 2, but its rank is not yet known.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching one new card, and also "filling in" the green 2.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Play Clue_ on the blue 2. He plays it, but it is actually a red 2, and successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob's first thought was that this was a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, but no other new cards were touched as part of the clue. Thus, Bob knows that this is a _Duplicitous Tempo Clue_ instead.
  - Since Bob's green 2 was _Promptable_ and Alice was not in a valid stalling situation, Bob treats this as a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.

## Special Moves

<br />

### The Assisted Trash Chop Move

- _Trash Chop Moves_ can be incredibly useful; but what if there’s no way for Alice to simply and cleanly clue **known** trash?
- One clever solution is to perform an _Assisted Trash Chop Move_: this is when a _Trash Bluff_ or (single-touch) _Unknown Trash Discharge_ gets a known _Dupe_ to blind-play.
- The ultimate goal of such a clue will be clear to the team: communicate a _Trash Chop Move_ on all cards to the right of the clued card(s).
- For an example of an _Assisted Trash Bluff_, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a known Yellow 1.
  - Cathy's hand is r5, g3, b1, y4, g4.
  - Alice clues 1 to Cathy, as a _Trash Bluff_.
  - Bob and Cathy gasp as Bob blind-plays Yellow 1.
  - Alice's intention becomes clear to everyone: she wanted to provide Cathy with safe _Known Trash_, and expects Cathy to _Trash Chop Move_ her two cards behind the b1.
- For an example of an _Assisted Trash Discharge_, in a 3-player game:
  - The situation is the same as above.
  - Alice clues blue to Cathy, as an _Unknown Trash Discharge_.
  - Bob and Cathy gasp as Bob plays Yellow 1 from _Third Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy evaluates. If Alice's clue had touched a secondary blue card, this would simply be a [Duplicitous Blind-Play](#duplicitous-blind-play).
  - But since Alice's clue only resulted in _Known Trash_ being touched, Alice must have intended a _Trash Chop Move_ on Cathy.

<br />

### The Time Travel Chop Move (Direct Form)

- If Alice performs a _Duplicitous Clue_ that doesn’t touch other good cards or provide immediate _Tempo Fill-In_ information, it must have been done for some other reason.
- After the _Dupe_ reveals itself, the clued player can interpret the clue as a _Trash CM_ on their own hand (as if it were _Time Traveled_ _Known Trash_, from the future).
- Thus, the clued player _Chop Moves_ all cards that were to the right of the clued dupe.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All 2s are played.
  - Cathy holds a known Purple 3.
  - Alice clues 3 to Bob, newly touching a single card.
  - Bob plays his 3 and gasps when he sees it's Purple 3.
  - Since this was effectively a 0-for-1, Alice must have chosen this line in order to give Bob _Known Trash_.
  - Therefore, the team can all tell that Alice performed a _Time Travel Chop Move_. Bob _Chop Moves_ all the cards that were behind his Purple 3.

<br />

### The Time Travel Chop Move (Blind-Play Form)

- What if Alice wishes to perform a _Time Travel Chop Move_ on Bob, but is unable to cleanly clue it directly by itself?
- In such a case, Alice can still attempt to force the dupe to blind-play. She must choose carefully, though, to ensure that the end result is truly 'bad' enough to result in a full _Time Travel Chop Move_!
- More specifically, such a blind-play must be sure to avoid the following conditions:
  - The clue can’t otherwise meet _Minimum Clue Value Principle_.
  - The clue can’t simply look like a normal [Assisted Trash CM](#the-assisted-trash-chop-move) on the clue receiver.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All 1s are played. Donald has a known Blue 2.
  - Bob has a previously clued red card. Alice reclues it with a 3 clue, touching no other cards.
  - Bob blind-plays as a _Self-Bluff_, but is shocked when a Blue 2 is played.
  - Since this resulted in a 0-for-1 - and it wasn’t any sort of potential emergency - Bob understands that he should _Chop Move_ everything that was behind his Blue 2, as a _Time Travel Chop Move_.
- In advanced games, it's also possible to perform _Time Travel Chop Moves_ further away from slot 1, by using certain 0-for-1 advanced techniques (such as _Useless Clue Ejections_, _Bad TCCME_,_Trash Push UTD_, etc).
