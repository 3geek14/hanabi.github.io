# Specific Conventions for Deceptive-Fives

These conventions apply to the "Deceptive-Fives" variants.

<br />

### Deceptive 5 Saves

- Any color clue to a chop card is first and foremost to be treated as a *Save Clue* on a 5.

### Deceptive Loaded Play Clues

- *Loaded Play Clues* are turned on but only apply to the color clues focusing on *Chop*.

### Rank Save Promise

- The rank of a *Chop-Focus* number clue must match the number of the card. In other words, players are not allowed to use a rank clue to touch a 5 if it is on chop.
