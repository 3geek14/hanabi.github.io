# Specific Conventions for Omni

These conventions apply to any variant with an omni (touched by all clues) suit.

### Pink Conventions

- All pink conventions also apply to omni cards.

### No Good Touch Principle

- *Good Touch Principle* does **not** apply to known omni cards. Thus, it may be dangerous for players to play them without being *Prompted* first.
