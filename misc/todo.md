### TODO

- right now, the numbers that are drawn on clue arrows are stylized incorrectly. we either need to:
  1. generate new number pips that actually match the website
  1. use `ctx_file.text` to just draw text like you do for the number pips at the bottom of the card
- small bug on Chop Moves & New Clues section - in the 2nd example, clue arrows should be different when re-touching cards to made how it looks on Hanab Live
