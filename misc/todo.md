### TODO

- right now, the numbers that are drawn on clue arrows are stylized incorrectly. we either need to:
  1. generate new number pips that actually match the website
  1. use `ctx_file.text` to just draw text like you do for the number pips at the bottom of the card
- beginner's guide
- level 3
  - Fix Clues
  - Playing Multiple 1's
- level 8 and beyond
- remove all negate (probably)
- small bug on Chop Moves & New Clues section - in the 2nd example, clue arrows should be different when re-touching cards to made how it looks on Hanab Live

### Done

- level 1
- level 2
