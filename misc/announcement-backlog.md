## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

**The Turnabout Ejection** (clarification)

- Previously, *Turnabout Ejection* could only be performed on a 1 or a 5. Now, it can also be performed on any playable pink card.
- During the *Early Game*, *Turnabout Ejections* take precedence over *Bad Chop Move Ejections (with 5's)*. Afterwards, *Bad Chop Move Ejection* takes precedence.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 5's)* can only be performed with non-trash cards.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 1's)* cannot be performed once all 1's have been played.

**Pink Precedence** (by pianoblook)

- Normally, non-variant-specific conventions always take precedence over variant-specific conventions.
- As an exception, the *Bubblegum Bluff* and the *Taffy Bluff* conventions usually take precedence over their non-variant-specific alternatives. Specifically:
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Rank Choice Ejection (with 2)*.
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  - The *Bubblegum Bluff* and *Taffy Bluff* holds equal precedence to *4 Charm*; the clued player must therefore write identity notes for either option.
  - A true *Bubblegum Finesse* takes precedence over *4 Charm*. (This is because, unlike in the *Bluff* scenarios, the pink blind-play "connects" to the rank clue).

**Bubblegum Wraparound** (change)

- The *Bubblegum Wraparound* convention now only applies to variants with a light pink suit.
