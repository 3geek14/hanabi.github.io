# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

- The _Shout Discard Chop Move_ has been moved from level 23 to level 7.
- The _Shout Discard Order Chop Move_ has been moved from level 23 to level 14.
