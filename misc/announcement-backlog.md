## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Saves**

- This convention only applies in variants with a dark omni or gray pink suit.
- The rules for saving dark omni and gray pink suits have been slightly refined so that players can perform more 2-for-1 clues.
- See the website for more details: https://hanabi.github.io/docs/variant-specific/dark-omni-gray-pink/

**The Pink Fake Prompt & The Pink Fake Finesse** (by Jeff)

- This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
- First, see the section on the Pink Play Clue Lie.
- In the *Pink Play Clue Lie*, *Pink Promise* is violated when giving a *Play Clue* to a playable pink card. However, no special actions need to be taken from anyone else on the team, because the lie will automatically resolve when the card is played.
- In some special situations, it is possible to give a *Pink Play Clue Lie* that will **not** resolve automatically. In this situation, the next player must play a card to "fix" the lie.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 2 clue to Cathy, touching a pink 1 on slot 2. (Cathy does not have a playable card on slot 1.)
  - Bob knows that if he does nothing, Cathy will go on to interpret this as a *Self-Finesse*, and play her *Finesse Position*, which will misplay.
  - Thus, Bob plays his *Finesse Position* as a *Pink Fake Finesse*. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, Alice performed a *Finesse* on the blue 1 into the blue 2. Cathy plays the blue 2, but it is actually the pink 1. Now, Cathy knows that Alice performed a *Pink Fake Finesse*.

**The Fake 5's Chop Move** (by pianoblook)

- This convention only applies to variants with a dark pink, dark omni, or gray pink suit.
- Players are allowed to violate *Pink Promise* on dark pink cards in order to perform a *Fake 5's Chop Move*.
- This means that *Pink Promise* no longer applies to off chop cards when they are clued as a 5, unless it was just a *5 Stall*.

**The Fake 5 Pull & The Fake 5 Number Discharge** (by pianoblook)

- This convention only applies to variants with a dark pink, dark omni, or gray pink suit.
- Similar to the Fake 5's Chop Move, players can also violate *Pink Promise* in order to initiate a *5 Pull* or a *5 Number Discharge*.
- Sometimes, when a *5 Pull* is occurring, it can be ambiguous to other players on the team as to whether a *5 Pull* or a *5 Stall* is happening. However, when a *Fake 5 Pull* (or a *Fake 5 Number Discharge*) is happening, everyone can be sure that it is a *5 Pull*, because it would be illegal to violate *Pink Promise* when performing a *5 Stall*.

**The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue** (by Lel0uch)

- Sometimes, players have a clued prism card in their hand that matches a clued normal card in their hand.
- For example, in a "Prism (5 Suits)" game:
  - Bob has a blue 4 and a prism 4 in his hand. Both have been previously clued with a blue color clue, but Bob does not know the true identity of either card.
- In this situation, it is hard to give a *Tempo Clue* to the right-most card. Thus, we agree that:
  - a color *Tempo Clue* should focus the right-most card
  - a rank *Tempo Clue* should focus the left most card
