# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Clarified conventions:

_Double Ignitions_ and _Unnecessary Ignitions_ (by Stuurm)

```text
- Ignitions are now more strongly defined.
- For _Double Ignitions_:
  - The first _Ignition_ **must always be on Bob**, unless Bob has a known-playable card already. Then, it would be on the first player that does not already have a known-playable card.
  - The second _Ignition_ **must always be on the last player with a playable card**. (This is because the players in the middle will think that the last person is supposed to play, similar to how a normal _Ambiguous Finesse_ works.)
- For _Unnecessary Ignitions_:
  - The _Ignition_ is always on Bob, with two exceptions:
    - If Bob can already play a card on his turn and sees a playable card on someone else's _Finesse Position_, then the _Ignition_ is on the other player with the visible playable card.
    - If Bob was the receiver of the clue and is blind-playing from the clue, then the _Ignition_ is on the last player with a playable card on _Finesse Position_.
