## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

**The Asymmetric Chop Move Dilemma** (by Lel0uch)

- Sometimes, an asymmetric *Chop Move* occurs during a game.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - During the *Early Game*, Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 that is one-away-from-chop.
  - Bob does not see anything else for Alice to do, so Alice's clue is probably just a *5 Stall*.
  - However, it is also possible that Bob has a playable or savable card in his hand. If this is true, then Alice's clue would instead be an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  - Next, Alice clues Cathy, causing Bob to blind-play a card as a *Trash Bluff*.
  - In this situation, Bob cannot determine whether or not the *Trash Bluff* was an *Unnecessary Move*. Thus, without any other conventions, Bob is not sure where Cathy's chop card is.
- In such cases, we agree that Bob should assume that all moves are *Necessary*. This follows from *Occam's Razor*; assume the simplest possible thing is happening.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

**The Turnabout Ejection** (clarification)

- Previously, *Turnabout Ejection* could only be performed on a 1 or a 5. Now, it can also be performed on any playable pink card.
- During the *Early Game*, *Turnabout Ejections* take precedence over *Bad Chop Move Ejections (with 5's)*. Afterwards, *Bad Chop Move Ejection* takes precedence.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 5's)* can only be performed with non-trash cards.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 1's)* cannot be performed once all 1's have been played.

**Pink Precedence** (by pianoblook)

- Normally, non-variant-specific conventions always take precedence over variant-specific conventions.
- As an exception, the *Bubblegum Bluff* and the *Taffy Bluff* conventions usually take precedence over their non-variant-specific alternatives:
  - *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Rank Choice Ejection (with 2)*.
  - *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  - *Bubblegum Bluff* and *Taffy Bluff* holds equal precedence to *4 Charm*; the clued player must therefore write notes for either option.
  - A true *Bubblegum Finesse* takes precedence over *4 Charm* (this is because, unlike in the *Bluff* scenarios, the pink blind-play 'matches' the rank clue).
