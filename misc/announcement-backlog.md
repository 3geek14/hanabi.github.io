## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Moved conventions:

**Finesses with a Fix Component** (moved)

- *Finesses* with a *Fix Component* are now moved from level 22 to the "extras" section.

<br />

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

**The Turnabout Ejection** (clarification)

- Previously, *Turnabout Ejection* could only be performed on a 1 or a 5. Now, it can also be performed on any playable pink card.
- During the *Early Game*, *Turnabout Ejections* take precedence over *Bad Chop Move Ejections (with 5's)*. Afterwards, *Bad Chop Move Ejection* takes precedence.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 5's)* can only be performed with non-trash cards.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 1's)* cannot be performed once all 1's have been played.

**Pink Precedence** (by pianoblook)

- Normally, non-variant-specific conventions always take precedence over variant-specific conventions.
- As an exception, the *Bubblegum Bluff* and the *Taffy Bluff* conventions usually take precedence over their non-variant-specific alternatives. Specifically:
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Rank Choice Ejection (with 2)*.
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  - The *Bubblegum Bluff* and *Taffy Bluff* holds equal precedence to *4 Charm*; the clued player must therefore write identity notes for either option.
  - A true *Bubblegum Finesse* takes precedence over *4 Charm*. (This is because, unlike in the *Bluff* scenarios, the pink blind-play "connects" to the rank clue).

**Bubblegum Wraparound** (change) (by tim)

- The *Bubblegum Wraparound* convention now only applies to variants with a light pink suit.

**The Taffy Double Bluff** (by Kakashi)

- First, see the section on the Taffy Bluff.
- Rarely, a player can perform a *Taffy Double Bluff* by violating *Pink Promise* on a *two-away-from-playable* pink card.
- For example, in a 4 player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a pink 3 on slot 3.
  - Bob knows that since Alice violated *Pink Promise*, this must be some sort of *Bubblegum* move.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays on to the stacks.
  - From Donald's perspective, he knows that Alice performed a *Bubblegum Bluff*. Donald marks his slot 3 card as a pink 2 (the pink card that is *one-away-from-playable*).
  - Next, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy sees that Donald will mark his pink card as a pink 2. However, the card is really a pink 3, so the situation has not yet resolved.
  - Cathy blind-plays her slot 1 card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Donald realizes that if his clued card was a pink 2, then Cathy would not have done anything. Thus, this must have been a *Taffy Double Bluff*. Donald updates the note on his card to be a pink 3 (the pink card that is *two-away-from-playable*).
