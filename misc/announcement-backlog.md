# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone New conventions:

**The Duplicitous Value Clue** (by pianoblook)

```text
- Normally, we do not give _Play Clues_ to duplicated cards, as that would violate _Good Touch Principle_.
- However, in some situations, it is possible to give a _Play Clue_ to Bob and trick him into playing a duplicated card. If while doing so, the clue also picked up one or more other valuable cards, then this would be a _Duplicitous Value Clue_.
- We agree that as long as this kind of clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_ (not counting the duplicated card itself), no further _Prompts_ or blind-plays are called for - the point of the clue was to simply "lock in" a save on the valuable cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a globally-known red 3.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob as a _Play Clue_, touching 2 cards.
  - Bob plays the focused 3, assuming that it is the blue 3. However, it is actually red 3, and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, since there is sufficient value in "locking in" a save on Bob's other 3.
  - Bob marks his other 3 as **any** useful 3. It is not promised to be playable. (Thus, no-one will think that it is a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.)
- For _Duplicitous Value Clues_ that do **not** meet _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, see the _[Dupe Tempo Clue Principle](#dupe-tempo-clue-principle)_ section below.

**The Duplicitous Blind-Play** (by pianoblook)

```text
- In the _Duplicitous Value Clue_, a duplicated card is clued directly (in order to "get" some other cards). Similar to this, it is also possible to get a duplicated card to blind-play (in order to "get" some other cards). This is called a _Duplicitous Blind-Play_.
- _Duplicitous Blind-Plays_ function the same way as _Duplicitous Value Clues_ in that as long as the clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, no further _Prompts_ or blind-plays are called for.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a globally-known red 3.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, expecting it to be a blue 3 as a _Finesse_. Instead, it is a red 3, and successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Blind-Play_, since there is sufficient value in "locking in" a save on Donald's blue 4.
  - The team knows that blue 4 is not promised to be playable. (Thus, no-one will think that it is a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.)
- Note that _Duplicitous Blind-Plays_ can also be performed with certain _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and so on.

**The Duplicitous Tempo Clue** (by pianoblook)

```text
- First, see the section on the _[Duplicitous Value Clue](#duplicitous-value-clue)_ and the _[Duplicitous Blind-Play](#duplicitous-blind-play)_.
- In the _Duplicitous Value Clue_ and the _Duplicitous Blind-Play_, one or more "extra" valuable cards are touched for later. But what if this type of move is performed, but no additional valuable cards were touched?
- If a filled-in card is revealed as playable, the clue should retroactively be treated as a _Tempo Clue_. Thus, this type of clue is called a _Duplicitous Tempo Clue_.
- _Duplicitous Tempo Clues_ may or may not cause a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_. (The conditions for this are the same as a "normal" _Tempo Clue_.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Cathy holds a globally-known red 2.
  - Bob holds a previously-touched green 2, but its rank is not yet known.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching one new card, and also "filling in" the green 2.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Play Clue_ on the blue 2. He plays it, but it is actually a red 2, and successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob's first thought was that this was a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, but no other new cards were touched as part of the clue. Thus, Bob knows that this is a _Duplicitous Tempo Clue_ instead.
  - Since Bob's green 2 was _Promptable_ and Alice was not in a valid stalling situation, Bob treats this as a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.
