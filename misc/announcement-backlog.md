# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Clarified conventions:

**The Echo Shout Discard (Illegal)** (by pianoblook)

```text
- Unlike _Scream Discards_, _Shout Discards_ can not cause _Echo Chop Moves_. This is because discarding known trash is much less severe than intentionally discarding an unknown card (which would risk a game loss).
- Thus, Alice opting to discard a known trash card instead of playing is always either a single _Shout Discard Chop Move_ or a _Generation Discard_.
```

<br />

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone Clarified conventions:

**The Always Loaded Principle (ALP)** (by Zamiel)

```text
- Previously, whether or not the _Always Loaded Principle_ applied to number 5 clues was ambiguous.
- Now, as an official exception, the _Always Loaded Principle_ never applies to number 5 clues.

```
