## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

### The Always Loaded Principle

- In certain variants, a specific type of clue always looks like a *Save Clue* regardless of which cards are in the discard pile.
- For example:
  - In a dark prism variant, a 3 or 4 clue to the chop always looks like a *Save Clue* on prism 3 or prism 4.
  - In a brown variant, a brown clue to the chop always looks like a *Save Clue* on a brown 2, a brown 5, or another critical brown card.
- In such cases, we agree that this specific type of clue, if given to a player who is *Loaded*, must always be treated as a play clue. (This includes during the *Early Game*.)
- For example, in a 3-player game with a gray suit:
  - Gray 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues a gray 3 with a rank 3 clue on Cathy, who is currently *Loaded*.
  - Normally, Bob would assume that this is an *Early Save*. But due to the *Always Loaded Principle*, this must be a *Loaded Play Clue*.
  - Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a gray 2 and it successfully plays.
- One consequence of this principle is that in some cases, you can use it to get cards played that do not belong to a special suit.
- For example, in a 3-player game with a gray suit:
  - Gray 2 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues a critical blue 3 with a rank 3 clue on Cathy, who is currently *Loaded*.
  - Normally, Bob would assume that this is an *Early Save*. But due to the *Always Loaded Principle*, this must be a *Loaded Play Clue*.
  - If Bob does nothing, Cathy will assume that it is a *Loaded Play Clue* on the gray 3.
  - Thus, Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

**The Turnabout Ejection** (clarification)

- Previously, *Turnabout Ejection* could only be performed on a 1 or a 5. Now, it can also be performed on any playable pink card.
- During the *Early Game*, *Turnabout Ejections* take precedence over *Bad Chop Move Ejections (with 5's)*. Afterwards, *Bad Chop Move Ejection* takes precedence.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 5's)* can only be performed with non-trash cards.
- *Turnabout Ejections (with 1's)* cannot be performed once all 1's have been played.

**Pink Precedence** (by pianoblook)

- Normally, non-variant-specific conventions always take precedence over variant-specific conventions.
- As an exception, the *Bubblegum Bluff* and the *Taffy Bluff* conventions usually take precedence over their non-variant-specific alternatives. Specifically:
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Rank Choice Ejection (with 2)*.
  - The *Bubblegum* and *Taffy* conventions take precedence over *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  - The *Bubblegum Bluff* and *Taffy Bluff* holds equal precedence to *4 Charm*; the clued player must therefore write identity notes for either option.
  - A true *Bubblegum Finesse* takes precedence over *4 Charm*. (This is because, unlike in the *Bluff* scenarios, the pink blind-play "connects" to the rank clue).

**Bubblegum Wraparound** (change)

- The *Bubblegum Wraparound* convention now only applies to variants with a light pink suit.
