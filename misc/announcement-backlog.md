## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

### The Double Ejection (by Jeff)

- If a _Play Clue_ and an _Ejection_ are both possible as a 1-for-1, players are always expected to give a direct _Play Clue_. (We want to keep things simple and reduce the vector for mistakes to happen.)
- What happens if a player breaks this rule and does an _Ejection_ anyway? They must be trying to send an additional message.
- After Bob _Ejects_ in this situation, Cathy is expected to know that Alice really intended for a _Double Ejection_. Here, Cathy should also play her _Second Finesse Position_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Donald has a globally-known red 2 in his hand. (It was given a _Play Clue_ earlier with a number 2 clue.)
  - Alice gives a red clue to Donald, filling in the 2 as a red 2.
  - Bob sees that since the red 2 was _already_ going to play on the stacks, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Normally, Bob would think that this is a _Replay Double Ignition_. However, it can't be that, because Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_, which is trash.
  - Thus, Bob knows that Alice must be intend for a _Replay Ejection_ instead. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Just like Bob, Cathy is able to see that Alice's clue was a _Replay Ejection_. However, Cathy also notices that blue 1 was not blocked, meaning that Alice could just given a blue clue to Bob as a direct _Play Clue_. Doing a _Replay Ejection_ in this situation does not make any sense.
  - Cathy knows that in this situation, Alice is intending for a _Double Ejection_. Cathy blind-plays her _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 2 and successfully plays.
- Situations that call for _Double Ejections_ are very similar to situations that call for _Double Ignitions_. Notice that if Cathy's _Finesse Position_ is a playable or a one-away-from-playable card, Alice's _Double Ejection_ would not work: Bob would blind-play his _Finesse Position_ as a _Double Ignition_. However, since Cathy does not have a playable, Bob thinks to himself: "Even though this clue is pretty weird, Alice is probably just doing an _Ejection_ as a 1-for-1 here because I have some blocking card in my hand." After Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_, Cathy sees that the move was _Unnecessary_. But unlike a normal _Unnecessary_ move (where Cathy would be expected to blind-play her _Finesse Position_ card), here Cathy knows that it makes more sense to blind-play her _Second Finesse Position_ card (since her _First Finesse Position_ card must be unplayable).
