# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Renamed conventions:

_The Transfer Chop Move_ (rename)

```text
- The _Chop Transfer_ is renamed to the _Transfer Chop Move_, so that it has the same format as all of the other chop moves.
```

_The Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ (by Lel0uch)

```
- The _The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue_ now applies to every variant that has ambiguous cards that are impossible to distinguish between, such as Deceptive-Fives or Odds & Evens.
- In short, we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - a rank _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.
```
