# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone New conventions:

_The Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ (by Lel0uch)

```text
- The _The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue_ now applies to every variant that has ambiguous cards that are impossible to distinguish between, such as Deceptive-Fives or Odds & Evens.
- In short, we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - a rank _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.
```

@everyone Clarified conventions:

_The Bad Chop Move Ejection_ (by Omegaxis)

```text
- Note that sometimes, players perform _Chop Moves_ on the other copy of currently clued cards. This can be useful for distribution purposes, meaning that everyone will have a card to play on the final round of the game. For this reason, a _Bad Chop Move Ejection_ can only be triggered when chop moving cards that have been played already.
```

@everyone Renamed conventions:

_The Transfer Chop Move_ (rename)

```text
- The _Chop Transfer_ is renamed to the _Transfer Chop Move_, so that it has the same format as all of the other chop moves.
```
