## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Saves**

- This convention only applies in variants with a dark omni or gray pink suit.
- The rules for saving dark omni and gray pink suits have been slightly refined so that players can perform more 2-for-1 clues.
- See the website for more details: https://hanabi.github.io/docs/variant-specific/dark-omni-gray-pink/

**The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue** (by Lel0uch)

- Sometimes, players have a clued prism card in their hand that matches a clued normal card in their hand.
- For example, in a "Prism (5 Suits)" game:
  - Bob has a blue 4 and a prism 4 in his hand. Both have been previously clued with a blue color clue, but Bob does not know the true identity of either card.
- In this situation, it is hard to give a *Tempo Clue* to the right-most card. Thus, we agree that:
  - a color *Tempo Clue* should focus the right-most card
  - a rank *Tempo Clue* should focus the left most card
