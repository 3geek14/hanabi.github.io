# Alternate Accounts in the Hyphenated Group

The Hyphenated group uses a Discord server as a hub for communication. Since using Discord is free, it is possible to create as many accounts as you want and join the server as many times as you want. However, we want each Hyphenated member to have only have one Discord account, as this enforces accountability and eases administration.

Note that for the purposes of the Hanab Live website itself, playing with an alternate website account is fine as long as it is clear to the other Hyphenated members that you are playing with what your true identity is
