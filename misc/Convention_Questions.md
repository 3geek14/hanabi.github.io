## Convention Questions

Ask questions about the Hyphen-ated conventions in the in the `#convention-questions` channel. But please follow these rules:

### 1) Use Replay Links or Use Alice and Bob Stories

- If the question is about **a real game**, then you must include a link to the game by using the `/replay [game id] [turn number]` command.
- Do **not** post a screenshot of the game state.
- If the question is about **a hypothetical**, then you must type out an Alice and Bob story in the style of the convention docs.
- (Hypotheticals are generally preferred to replays, since they narrows down the scope of what is happening.)

### 2) Use Hyphen-ated Notation

Use notation that the Hyphen-ated group will be familiar with:

- Use "red 3" instead of "3 red".
- Use "r3" instead of "3r".
- Use "r[3]" to indicate that a card is a red 3 but has a number 3 clue on it.
- If using a replay, then use the names of the players in the replay.
- If using a hypothetical, always use the characters of Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, Emily, and Frank. (Alice should always be the player who performs the first action.)

### 3) Use the Convention Level

- You **must** include a convention level with your question (even if you think it is obvious).
- Use the level that the players of the game were playing with or the level relating to the convention that you are asking about.

### 4) Answer Your Own Question (and Provide a Detailed Explaination)

- You **must** attempt to answer your own question, based on your current understanding of the conventions.
- Provide a detailed explanation as to **why** you think it is the best answer, linking to the relevant sections of the website if necessary.
- For example, the following question will be deleted:
  - /replay 12345 12<br />Is this a 5 Stall or a 5 Pull?
- For example, the following question is good:
  - /replay 12345 12<br />Here, it is Alice's turn. It is also the Early Game and no 5 Stalls have been given yet. Thus, based on my understanding of the conventions, when Alice clues number 5 to Bob, it would just be a 5 Stall, because 1) there is no other possible clues that Alice can give, and 2) Alice is not allowed to discard and end the Early Game without first doing at least one 5 Stall. Is this correct?

### 5) One Message

- Type out your entire question into one message.

### Reasoning

- The reason for needing replays is that different people play in different modes (color-blind, art styles, card orientation, etc.).
- The reason for needing Alice and Bob stories is that it helps us parse your question more easily.
- The reason for rule 2 is that it helps us parse your question more easily.
- The reason for rule 3 is that it helps us narrow the scope of the question, it serves as a flag to let others know what kind of question it is, and it prevents lower level players from attempting to answer.
- The reason for rule 4 is that it allows us to hone in on the specific gaps in your knowledge. It is unfair to ask a low-effort question and then expect others to give a comprehensive response to it.
- The reason for rule 5 is that it prevents spamming other people with notifications.
