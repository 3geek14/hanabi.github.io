## Convention Questions

When asking questions in the `#convention-questions` channel, please remember to:

1) Include the convention level that the current players of the game are playing with.
2) Put effort into your question. Explain what **you** think the best answer is, based on your current understanding of the conventions. Provide a detailed explanation as to **why** you think it is the best answer. Discuss any relevant contextual clues present in the game that influence the answer, if any. Provide an alternate answer that might also be the case and discuss why that answer is not as good.

* The reason for 1 is that it helps others better parse the question, it serves as a flag to let others know what kind of question it is, and it prevents lower level players from attempting to answer.)
* The reason for 2 is that it allows us to hone in on the specific gaps in your knowledge.
