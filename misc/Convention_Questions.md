## Convention Questions

Ask questions about the Hyphen-ated conventions in the in the `#convention-questions` channel. But please follow these 5 rules:

### 1) Replay Links

* If the question is about **a real game**, then you must include a link to the game by using the /replay command.
* Do **not** post a screenshot of the game state.

### 2) Alice and Bob Stories

* If the question is about **a hypothetical**, please type out an Alice and Bob story in the style of the convention docs.

### 3) Hyphen-ated Notation

Use notation that the Hyphen-ated group will be familiar with:
- Use "red 3" instead of "3 red".
- Use "r3" instead of "3r".
- Use "r[3]" to indicate that a card is a red 3 but has a number 3 clue on it.
- If using a replay, then use the names of the players in the replay.
- If using a hypothetical, always use the characters of Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, Emily, and Frank. (Alice should always be the player who performs the first action.)

### 4) Convention Level

* You must include a convention level with your question (even if you think it is obvious).
* Use the level that the players of the game were playing with or the level relating to the convention that you are asking about.

### 5) High-Effort Questions

* Short questions are fine if you just need clarification about something simple.
* However, avoid asking questions like: "here is my replay, does the clue mean X or Y?", or "here is my replay, what is the best move?"
* Instead, explain what **you** think the best answer is, based on your current understanding of the conventions.
* Provide a detailed explanation as to **why** you think it is the best answer.
* Discuss any relevant contextual clues present in the game that influence the answer, if any.
* For example, the following question is bad:
  * /replay 12345 12 Is this a 5 Stall or a 5 Pull?
* For example, the following question is good:
  * /replay 12345 12 Here, it is Alice's turn. It is also the Early Game and no 5 Stalls have been given yet. Thus, based on my understanding of the conventions, when Alice clues number 5 to Bob, it would just be a 5 Stall, because there is no other possible clues that Alice can give, and Alice is not allowed to discard and end the Early Game without first doing at least one 5 Stall. Is this correct?

### Reasoning

* The reason for #1 is that different people play in different modes (color-blind, art styles, card orientation, etc.).
* The reason for #2 and #3 is that it helps us parse your question more easily.
* The reason for #4 is that it helps us narrow the scope of the question, it serves as a flag to let others know what kind of question it is, and it prevents lower level players from attempting to answer.
* The reason for #5 is that it allows us to hone in on the specific gaps in your knowledge. It is unfair to ask a low-effort question and then expect others to give a comprehensive response to it.
